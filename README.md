# BarcodeApp

This app asks users to submit a barcode for a product and rate it out of 5 and it also gives them the option to leave a comment. This input is then stored on a database to be analysed. The idea is to gather a lot of ratings from people and analyse them to get an idea of what they think about a product, this can allow companies to know how their customers feel about their products and also let people who have never used those products get an idea of how good they are before purchasing them.
